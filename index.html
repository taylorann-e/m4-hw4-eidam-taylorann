            <h2>Why Cody Johnson Is My Favorite</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Cody Johnson, also known as CoJo, is my favorite artist because of his authenticity. He writes what is on his heart whether it is relevant in pop culture or not. He speaks and mind and it is reflected in his lyrics and music. He adores his wife, and respects a traditional lifestyle. He reminds me of the country artists I grew up listening to.</p>
